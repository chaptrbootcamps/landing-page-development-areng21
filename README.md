### Build a responsive landing page with HTML and CSS
For this project, you will apply your skills learned across the last two weeks to build a landing page website. You can feel free to use additional frameworks such as Bootstrap, Tailwind, and SASS on the project. Based on your interest, you can opt for any of the following projects and you can find the design files on the corresponding folder:

- Easybank Landing Page
- Clipboard Landing Page
- Fylo Dark Theme Landing Page

Note that you only need to work on one of the projects. You can delete all other irrelevant folders once you make a choice and start working on your project. This project will be reviewed by technical mentors and we expect the output to be similar to what has been depicted on the deisgn files for moobile and desktop.
